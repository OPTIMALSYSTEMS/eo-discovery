/**
 * Example (micro) service that uses https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx to extract data from excel sheets.
 * This is for demonstation usage only. For production the propper error handling is missing.
 * You must 'npm install --no-save xlsx' before you can run this example by running 'node example/excel.js'.
 *
 * If the service is registered in the registry, every one can call 'POST /ExcelReader' with a excel
 * file as body to retrieve a JSON with all data inside the excel worksheet.
